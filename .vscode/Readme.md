# Custom IDE settings

This `settings.json` contains custom VS Code configuration. Note, this will only work with VS Code.

### Required extensions

- **Restore Terminals**: Restore the default set of terminals, so you won't have to run them again everytime you open VS Code.
  - `trustify-app`: The running application instance.
  - `drizzle-studio`: Drizzle Studio for local development.
  - `redis-store`: Running redis instance inside docker.
